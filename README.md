# Welcome to ThunderCore

[ThunderCore](https://www.thundercore.com/) is a highly performant, provably secure blockchain designed with EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatibility built in. This means that all of the popular plugins you're familiar with and smart contracts you have written will run smoothly on Thunder, instantly increasing their peformance as a result.

If you've been keeping an eye on blockchain news, you've probably heard of [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/). Due to CryptoKitties being one of the first mainstream dApps that gained a lot of steam with it's highly addictive game mechanics, it caused Ethereum to reach transaction levels it had never reached previously, showing some of the limitations of the Ethereum blockchain in it's current state. 

Thunder can help alleviate stress like this from the blockchain with our speedy transaction confirmation times.

Here, we have forked Cheshire, a fantastic tool from [Endless Nameless](http://endlessnameless.com) for developing dApps based around CryptoKitties. It's a sandbox environment that employs the CryptoKitties smart contracts and web API. The original README was left intact at the bottom of this README.

## Setting up Cheshire for Thunder

There are a few minor differences in how one interacts Thunder, so we made a few changes to Cheshire to help you get started a bit faster.

### Here's what we added:

We added [`truffle-hdwallet-provider`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-hdwallet-provider) >= 0.0.6 as a dependency. While Cheshire provides its own blockchain via `ganache-cli` for testing, we needed to connect to Thunder. Since one cannot currently run a local node, you need to unlock your account by providing your mnemonic into `HDWalletProvider` in order to deploy contracts and call functions as your account.

Within `truffle.js`, we have also added a new network, `thunder`, that utilizes this provider. This enables you to sign transactions and verify your identity without unlocking your acount directly on your node. The version of `HDWalletProvider` we are using has 4 arguments - the mnemonic, the RPC url, the index of the address within your wallet that you want to start adding to your wallet from, and the number of accounts you want to generate for your wallet. Here, we are starting from the first account (0), and generating 10 accounts. Only the first account is 

To securely pass these variables into `truffle.js`, we added `dotenv` as a dependency. This allows you to pass environment variables into this app through a `.env` file that you should create in the root directory of this repo. We have added this to the `.gitignore`. Alternatively, you can manually export them on the command line and it will still work.

In general, it is a good practice to connect to any blockchain like this. Having your blockchain unlocked for any amount of time is a very vulnerable point; anyone will have full control of the unlocked accounts. An alternative to this would be using the native Web3 function `web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount` to generate an account object, and using `web3.eth.accounts.wallet.encrypt(password)` to encrypt that account object for future use.

Within `lib/contract.js`, we imorted HDWalletProvider and dotenv. The `Contract.web3Provider` function additionally was updated to return this provider instead of the localhost based HttpProvider. The previous value was left there, commented out.

Within `./server.js`, we bypassed the initialization of the Ganache chain by commenting out `this.startTestnet()` within `Server.start()` since it was unnecessary for our testing purposes out.

Finally, we commented out a few assertions from the test suite. These lines were hard coded wallet and contract addresses that were predictable when using Ganache, but did not apply to general usage on a public chain.

### Here's what you need to do:

1. Make sure `Truffle` is installed globally (`npm i -g truffle`) to run tests and migrations.

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the repository. Add your Thunder RPC URL (`THUNDER_RPC`) and mnemonic (`MNEMONIC`) to this. Make sure the RPC has the `http://` prefix. This will be used within the provider declaration in `truffle.js` as well as `lib/contract.js`.

Your `.env` should look like this:

```
THUNDER_RPC=http://....:8545
MNEMONIC=12 word bip39 mnemonic...
```

3. Replace the account and private key fields in the `config.json` file with accounts generated by your mnemonic. Most of the accounts are for testing purposes. **_NB: Your addresses and keys should be lowercase. There will be an error_**
  - A quick way to check this is to open the truffle console with `truffle console --network thunder`. You have direct access to the Web3 API connected to Thunder. You can then call `web3.eth.getAccounts().then(accounts => console.log(accounts))` or `web3.eth.getAccounts((err, accounts) => console.log(err, accounts))` to log them.

4. Add funds to the 10 accounts generated from your mnemonic.
  - The console will come in handy again here if you don't automate this. You can call `web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: [ACCOUNT_WITH_FUNDS], to: [ACCOUNT_WITHOUT_FUNDS]}, value: [VALUE_TO_SEND])`

At this point, the contracts should be able to be deployed and the API up and running when you run `yarn start`. You may run the test suite with `yarn test`. You can also interact with the contract directly through `truffle console --network thunder` and call the different contract names (e.g. `KittyCore`). For more information on the inner workings of this sandbox, see the original README below.

# Cheshire - CryptoKitties Sandbox

Cheshire enables fast CryptoKitties dApp development by providing local implementations of the CryptoKitties web API and smart contracts. It features:

1. An **Ethereum testnet** running the CryptoKitties smart contracts

2. An HTTP server running a **minimal implementation of the CryptoKitties web API**:
   * `/kitties`
   * `/kitties/:id`
   * `/user/:address`

3. A simple **Node.js framework** for seeding the development environment with realistic data and bootstraping your dApp

Cheshire has simplified and accelerated development at [Endless Nameless](http://endlessnameless.com) considerably. We're excited to share it.

## Installation

You can install Cheshire with git or as a [Truffle Box](http://truffleframework.com/boxes/).

### Git

```bash
git clone http://github.com/endless-nameless-inc/cheshire
cd cheshire
yarn install
```

### Truffle box

```bash
truffle unbox endless-nameless-inc/cheshire
```

## Usage

Cheshire is meant to be used with the [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/), but can function as a standalone service, depending on your workflow.

### Start Cheshire

To start Cheshire, run:

`yarn start`

This does the following:

1. Starts an Ethereum testnet ([ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli))
2. Deploys CryptoKitties's [KittyCore](https://etherscan.io/address/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d#code), [SaleClockAuction](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1690c08e213a35ed9bab7b318de14420fb57d8c#code), and [SiringClockAuction](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc7af99fe5513eb6710e6d5f44f9989da40f27f26#code) contracts to the testnet
3. Starts a local CryptoKitties API server
4. Executes `/scripts/setup.js`

The output should look something like this:

```
> Starting database...
> Starting testnet...
> Compiling contracts...
> Deploying CryptoKitties contracts to testnet...
> Starting local CryptoKitties API server...
> Running setup script...

Eureka! When Cheshire's running, you have your very own local copy of CryptoKitties, enabling you to build your dApp with the speed and convenience of testnet. Let's try it out.

### Interacting with your local CryptoKitties API

Cheshire automatically imports the Genesis kitty. To fetch the Genesis kitty from your local CryptoKitties API, run:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:4000/kitties/1
```

The response should look exactly like the response returned by CryptoKitties's [production API](https://api.cryptokitties.co/kitties/1).

See the [scripts](#scripts) section below to learn how to seed your environment with more data.

### Interacting with the testnet contracts

To interact with the testnet contracts, start by opening a Truffle console:

```bash
$ truffle console --network cheshire
```

Then, taking note of the KittyCore testnet address displayed when you started Cheshire, create an instance of KittyCore, and use the `getKitty` function to fetch the Genesis kitty's genes:

```bash
truffle(cheshire)> // Be sure to replace the KittyCore address below
truffle(cheshire)> kittyCore = KittyCore.at('0xa751b62893867d0608a2ada5d17d0c43e3433040')
truffle(cheshire)> kittyCore.getKitty(1)
```

The response should be pretty similar to the one you get from the [mainnet contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d#readContract).

## Suggested Conventions

You'll get the most out of Cheshire by adopting these conventions:

* Store your contracts in the `/contracts` directory
* Design the web application layers of your stack to reference Cheshire's [environment variables](#cheshire-environment-variables) (hat tip to the [twelve-factor](https://12factor.net) methodology)
* Update your [setup script](#setup-script) to deploy your contracts to testnet
* Update your [setup script](#setup-script) to start your dApp's web application

## Scripts

Cheshire provides a simple scripting framework designed to help seed the development environment with realistic data, primarily by importing kitties from mainnet.

A Cheshire script is just a Node.js module that runs in the context of the Cheshire environment.

Here's an example of a script that imports a [Bug Cat](https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/101) from mainnet to your testnet.

```js
// /scripts/import-bug-cat.js
module.exports = async function importBugCat(cheshire) {
  const bugCatIdMainnet = 101
  const ownerTestnet = cheshire.accounts[0].address
  const kittyIdTestnet = await cheshire.importKitty(bugCatIdMainnet, ownerTestnet)

  console.log(`Kitty #${kittyIdTestnet} => ${ownerTestnet}`)
}
```

To run this script, you would execute the following command:

```sh
$ yarn run script ./scripts/import-bug-cat.js
```

The output would look something like:

```txt
Kitty #2 => 0x182fc09c33fdd6c2f5b2562f3ca721fa954689c8
```

### Setup Script

Cheshire executes `/scripts/setup.js` when started. You should update the `setup.js` shipped with Cheshire to:

1. Deploy your dApp's contracts to testnet. For example:

   ```
   const kittyRace = await cheshire.deployContract('KittyRace', process.env.ADDRESS_KITTY_CORE)
   log('KittyRace deployed at:', kittyRace.address)
   ```

2. Start your dApp's web application, so it inherits the various [environment variables](#cheshire-environment-variables) set by Cheshire.

   We recommend adopting the convention in the `setup.js` shipped with Cheshire which simply expects the `APP_START` environment variable to contain a command that starts your dApp's web application.

   For example:

   ```
   APP_START="cd ~/Projects/kittyrace-web; bundle exec rails server" yarn start
   ```

You can run any script in place of `setup.js` by passing its path to `yarn start`. This is handy for setting up specific scenarios, such as a KittyRace with 9 registered racers:

```sh
yarn start ./scripts/setup-registered-racers.js 9
```

### Cheshire API Reference

Cheshire scripts receive an instance of the Cheshire class with these methods:

#### `accounts()`
Returns array of available Ethereum accounts (the same accounts defined in config.json)

#### `contractAddress(contractName)`
Returns address of `contractName`

#### `contractInstance(contractName)`
Returns an instance of `contractName` as a `web3.eth.contract` object

#### `createKitty(matronId, sireId, generation, genes, owner, apiObject)`
Create a kitty with the given parameters.

Returns the kitty's ID.

#### `async deployContract(contractName, ...constructorArgs)`
Deploy `contractName` to testnet.

Cheshire compiles all contracts in `/contracts` at start time. Expects `/contracts/ContractName.sol` to exist.

Returns an instance of `contractName` as a `web3.eth.contract` object

#### `async importKitty(kittyIdMainnet, ownerTestnet)`
Import a kitty from mainnet, and assign it to `ownerTestnet`

Returns the testnet kitty's ID.

#### `async importUser(addressMainnet, addressTestnet)`
Import user's profile and kitties from mainnet, and assign to `addressTestnet`.

Returns address of testnet user.

### Cheshire Environment Variables

Cheshire sets several environment variables before running any script:

* `ADDRESS_KITTY_CORE`
* `ADDRESS_SALE_CLOCK_AUCTION`
* `ADDRESS_SIRING_CLOCK_AUCTION`
* `URL_CRYPTO_KITTIES_API`

In addition to these, the address for any contract deployed with a Cheshire script will be stored in an environment variable named with the convention, `ADDRESS_<CONTRACT_NAME>`.

## Configuration

The `config.json` file defines the following:

* `accounts` - list of Ethereum accounts to load into testnet
* `ethNodeMainnet` - URL for the node used to access the Ethereum mainnet
* `addressKittyCoreMainnet` - address of the mainnet KittyCore contract
* `portTestnet` - port bound by Ethereum testnet
* `portApi` - port bound by local CryptoKitties API

## Utilities

### Mine
To mine some number of blocks on your testnet:

`yarn run mine <num blocks>`

### Help
Print information about the environment including available Ethereum accounts, contract addresses, etc.

`yarn run help`

### Cheshire Dashboard
Cheshire ships with a simple dashboard you can access at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

## Developer notes

### KittyCore

The smart contracts bundled with Cheshire are identical to those in production except for KittyCore, to which we've added an `external` `createKitty` function that lets us push kitties into the local testnet contract.

```solidity
function createKitty(
    uint256 _matronId,
    uint256 _sireId,
    uint256 _generation,
    uint256 _genes,
    address _owner
)
    external
    returns (uint)
{
  return _createKitty(_matronId, _sireId, _generation, _genes, _owner);
}
```

### Contributions

Cheshire works pretty well for us at [Endless Nameless](http://endlessnameless.com), but there's probably a whole lot more it could do!

If you're interested in contributing, we humbly request the following:

1. Adhere to Airbnb's [JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) (`yarn eslint` makes it easy)
